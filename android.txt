I have installed Android studio and flutter.
Navigate to the folder where you wish to store the prgrams/applications,(I have made a new folder in D drive/ Flutter Projects) open that in cmd by rightclick
then create a new flutter project there using command "flutter create projectname"
once the project is created, open android studio/vs code and there open the project folder.

Goto /lib/main.dart    replace the exisiting code with the one present in the mail

after running them successfully


follow the rest of the steps to push them into the repo
open terminal in android studio/ VS code -> then click on + to add the git bash terminal
in git bash do the following

NOTE: PREFER VS CODE, Android studio might crash the device, use chrome to check the output

git init

----> //optional => git add README.md  <----
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/sharmavaibhav31/flutter_fundamentals.git




check the status of the files -> git status
if the file names are red in color- this means that they are not added to the repo, run command 
git add .
then 
git commit -m "Message/application name"
git push
